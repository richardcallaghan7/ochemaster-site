        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>OcheMaster ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application for dart throw biomechanical analysis.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Video & Pose Data</h3>
        <p>When you record or select a video for analysis, OcheMaster extracts body pose data (landmark positions for shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hips) directly on your device using on-device machine learning. <strong>Your video never leaves your device.</strong> Only the extracted pose keypoints (approximately 200KB of coordinate data) are sent to our servers for biomechanical analysis.</p>

        <h3>Analysis Results</h3>
        <p>We store the results of your throw analysis, including scores, metrics, coaching feedback, and timestamps, to enable progress tracking features.</p>

        <h3>Device Identifier</h3>
        <p>We generate a random device identifier (UUID) stored locally on your device. This identifier is used to associate your sessions with your device and is not linked to any personally identifiable information. It is not an advertising identifier.</p>

        <h3>Usage Analytics</h3>
        <p>We collect anonymous usage statistics (such as which features are used and how often) to improve the app experience. See Section 7 for details on third-party analytics services.</p>

        <h3>Crash Reports</h3>
        <p>If the app crashes, we collect diagnostic information (stack traces, device model, OS version) to identify and fix bugs. Crash reports do not contain video data or personal information.</p>

        <h3>Waitlist Data</h3>
        <p>If you sign up for our waitlist, we collect your email address to notify you about product availability.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To analyze your dart throwing technique and provide biomechanical feedback</li>
            <li>To generate AI-powered coaching narratives and training plans</li>
            <li>To track your progress and show improvement trends over time</li>
            <li>To maintain and improve the quality of our analysis algorithms</li>
            <li>To provide technical support and respond to your inquiries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. On-Device Processing</h2>
        <p>OcheMaster uses Google's MediaPipe pose estimation running entirely on your device to extract body landmarks from your videos. The video file stays on your phone at all times. Only the extracted pose coordinates are transmitted to our servers for throw detection, metric computation, and coaching analysis. This approach minimizes data transmission and keeps your video data private.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your analysis data is stored on secure, encrypted servers hosted by Railway (cloud infrastructure provider)</li>
            <li>We use PostgreSQL with encrypted connections for data storage</li>
            <li>All data is transmitted over HTTPS with TLS encryption</li>
            <li>We implement industry-standard security measures including rate limiting, input validation, and security headers</li>
            <li>Access to your data is scoped by your device identifier &mdash; other users cannot access your sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>We retain your session data and analysis results for as long as you use the app. You can delete your data at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete individual sessions</strong> &mdash; swipe to delete any session from your history</li>
            <li><strong>Delete all data</strong> &mdash; use the "Delete All My Data" option in Settings to permanently remove all your sessions and associated data from our servers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon deletion, all associated data is permanently removed immediately. Waitlist email addresses can be removed by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anthropic Claude API</strong> &mdash; for AI-powered coaching narratives and training plans. We send anonymized throw metrics (scores and measurements only, no video or personal data) to generate personalized coaching feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentry</strong> (<a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">sentry.io</a>) &mdash; for crash reporting and error tracking. Collects device model, OS version, and stack traces when errors occur. No video or personal data is sent.</li>
            <li><strong>PostHog</strong> (<a href="https://posthog.com/privacy">posthog.com</a>) &mdash; for anonymous product analytics. Collects feature usage events tied to your device identifier. No video or personal data is sent.</li>
            <li><strong>Google MediaPipe</strong> &mdash; for on-device pose estimation. This runs entirely on your device and does not transmit any data to Google.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share your data with third parties except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With service providers listed in Section 7 who assist in operating our service (under strict confidentiality and data processing agreements)</li>
            <li>When required by law or to protect our legal rights</li>
            <li>Aggregated, anonymized data for research and service improvement (no individual users can be identified)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> &mdash; request a copy of the data we hold about you</li>
            <li><strong>Correction</strong> &mdash; request correction of inaccurate data</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong> &mdash; delete your data via the app (Settings &rarr; Delete All My Data) or by contacting us</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong> &mdash; export your session history in a portable JSON format via the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, use the in-app features or contact us at the address below.</p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>OcheMaster is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe we have collected information from your child, please contact us immediately and we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>11. Camera & Microphone Permissions</h2>
        <p>OcheMaster requests access to your device's camera and microphone to record videos of your dart throws for analysis. The microphone permission is required because iOS video recording includes audio by default. You can deny microphone access and still use the app by selecting pre-recorded videos from your photo library.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy in the app and on this page. Your continued use of OcheMaster after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your data rights, please contact us at:</p>
